# Operation Rurimi - The Night Before Deployment

## April 5, 2073, 23:45 - JASDF Hyakuri Air Base

### Inside the Aircraft - Transport Aircraft C-2 Kai "Raicho"

Amidst the continuous vibration of the aircraft, Colonel Tatsuya Kondo gazed out the window. The lights of Rurimi town, visible through gaps in the clouds, twinkled like stars. In his hand, he held a still-warm coffee cup.

"Commander, latest intel from Kanda."

Second Lieutenant Miyumi Tateyama approached. Beneath her usual composure, a subtle tension was visible on her face.

"What's the situation?"

"Chika's protection has not yet been successful. The 13th Division's movements are faster than expected. They've already begun deploying personnel throughout Rurimi."

Kondo let out a deep breath.

"What about Shimizu?"

"Data link construction in progress. Will be completed before operation commencement."

From the rear of the aircraft, Warrant Officer Kaori Kimura's voice echoed.

"Commander, reconnaissance drone results are in. We've detected anomalous access to Rurimi's communication infrastructure."

Kondo stood up and approached the large display in the center of the aircraft.

"Details."

"Yes. The 13th Division's advanced AI 'Eta' has infiltrated the town's surveillance systems and is collecting information through residents' Smart Eyes. Additionally, support from the new Red Box 'Theta' is suspected. Our electronic camouflage appears to be functioning properly."

First Lieutenant Toru Hida joined in.

"The EMP weapons are ready. However, their use in urban areas should be avoided, so they will be a last resort."

Tateyama continued.

"Final inspection of the Enhanced Suit f62 is complete. The link with Kagura is stable. MD59 usage authorization confirmed. Ammunition is secured for all personnel."

Kondo nodded.

"Understood. We'll execute the operation in stages. First, protect Harukaze Chika. Next, suppress the 13th Division's activities. Finally, protect civilians."

### Briefing Room - Inside the Base

As the aircraft landed, Kondo immediately headed to the briefing room. The room was filled with the main members of the Susanoo unit.

"Listen up, everyone."

Kondo's voice echoed. All eyes turned toward him.

"I think you all understand, but this operation holds extremely important significance for our nation. To secure the Ubiquitous Core, which could collapse the international military balance, conflict with the 13th Division has become unavoidable. While we've been drawn into Kanda's operation, this was bound to happen eventually. This will be our first direct confrontation. From tomorrow onward, we'll officially be enemies."

Tateyama raised her hand.

"Commander, is it correct to conclude that direct confrontation with the 13th Division is unavoidable?"

"Unfortunately, yes. They've already targeted Harukaze Chika and have already taken action. There's no room for negotiation."

Warrant Officer Hibiki Kanda spoke up.

"The target is still a high school student. We'd prefer not to drag her into a battlefield. But the 13th Division's main body is already moving directly. The standoff is over."

"That's exactly right. That's why we need to act. Time is limited."

Kondo pointed to the map of Rurimi town projected on the wall.

"Let me confirm again. The operation will be executed in three stages. Stage One: Ensure Chika's safety. Stage Two: Intervene in the 13th Division's operations. Stage Three: Ensure civilian safety."

Third Lieutenant Mirai Nitta asked a question.

"What's our countermeasure against the 13th Division's Red Box 'Eta'?"

"We'll use the anti-Red Box program developed by Shimizu with 'Kagura' support. We'll fight Red Box with Red Box. However, we can't use the same approach twice against a Red Box."

Hida continued.

"So it's electronic warfare. When will we use the EMP weapons?"

"As a last resort, but considering civilian casualties, I authorize each of you to use your own judgment."

Kondo looked around at everyone.

"Failure of this operation is not an option. However, civilian safety is also our top priority. I will take full responsibility. Do you understand?"

"Yes!"

Everyone's voices rang out in unison.

### Just Before Deployment

After the briefing ended, each team member began their final preparations. Kaori Kimura was conducting final inspections on six drones.

"Kaori."

Tateyama approached.

"Are you okay?"

"Yes, ma'am. But..."

Kimura stopped her hands.

"I was prepared for this, but actual combat in the city..."

"I feel the same way. But this is a fight to protect. That's our mission."

Tateyama placed her hand on Kimura's shoulder.


"Yes!"

At that moment, Kondo's voice echoed through the aircraft.

"Everyone, are you ready for deployment?"

"Ready!"

"Good, then let's deploy. Operation SY-0021, commence."

### Above Rurimi - Transport Aircraft C-2 Kai "Raicho"

The aircraft was circling above Rurimi town. Looking down, the town's lights were flickering unnaturally. It was evidence that the 13th Division's AI was manipulating the communication systems.

"Commander, the 13th Division's movements are intensifying! Multiple personnel have been confirmed around the school!"

Third Lieutenant Akemi Shimizu reported from the aircraft's communication terminal. Her tone was tense.

"What's Harukaze Chika's detailed current location?"

"She's at the gate of Rurimi High School. However, the 13th Division's vehicles have already secured the area. They intend to make contact. Time is running out!"

Kondo made his decision.

"Initiate Stage One. All personnel deploy. Prioritize Harukaze Chika's safety and prevent the 13th Division's contact. Use f62's flight units to rapidly advance to the scene."

Shimizu responded.

"Understood."
